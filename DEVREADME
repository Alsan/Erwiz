After you installed the developer toolchain go to the erwiz root directory and execute:

* ant package => compile and create the package & release files in <root>/package/{src,bin} and <root>/releases/single/
* ant -f release.xml release:<linux> => create a linux package, replace <linux> by the distribution you'd like to package for (e.g. archlinux, debian, ...)
