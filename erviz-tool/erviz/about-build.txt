To build jar file and create release archive files, use ant build script ("build.xml") with default target.

> ant -f build.xml

Then archive files will be generated in "release_archives" directory.

Build.xml refers "../erviz-core/src/jp/gr/java_conf/simply/erviz/common/resources/app_info.properties" and
use the written application name and version number to decise a jar name and archive file names.
If you release new version, update the "app_info.properties" then build this application.

The "release_files/_setup_/common/bin" directory contains one or more jar files.
On build time, the jar files will be generated in this directory, 
and they will be copied to archive files with script files.

The "release_files/_setup_/**/docs" contains document files which will be released.
On build time, they will be copied to archive files.
